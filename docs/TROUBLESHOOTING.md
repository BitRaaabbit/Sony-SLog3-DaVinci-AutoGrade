# Troubleshooting

## Script click produces no visible result

Check `%TEMP%\SonySLog3AutoGrade\diagnostic.log` and the emergency log `%TEMP%\SonySLog3AutoGrade_emergency.log`. Every invocation must contain `START`, a stage marker, and either `SUCCESS` or `ERROR` followed by `STOP`.

Resolve 20.3.2 Free was observed to expose a valid internal Resolve userdata through `app:GetResolve()` while `Resolve()` returned nil in the same Workspace script context. The public scripts therefore use `app:GetResolve()` and never load the external scripting module.

## Unicode Windows paths

Resolve's internal Lua `io.open` may report `No such file or directory` for an existing path containing Chinese or other Unicode characters. Keep Lua profiles, logs, reports, traceback, state, and temporary DRP staging under `%TEMP%\SonySLog3AutoGrade`.

This does not prove that Resolve's media APIs reject Unicode. Pass the original path directly to `MediaPool:ImportMedia`, verify its returned MediaPoolItem and exact File Path, and stop on failure. Do not create a junction or move source media as an automatic workaround.

## Playback FPS remains at the default

A real diagnostic set Timeline FPS first, after which `timelinePlaybackFrameRate` returned `false` for both `50` and `50.000` and continued to read `24`. No media had been imported.

The generic diagnostic sets and verifies Playback FPS first, then Timeline FPS. If an existing project is already locked to inconsistent values, preserve it and create a fresh isolated project rather than forcing changes or deleting content.

## ImportMedia returns no clip

Stop immediately. Record the requested path, `pcall` status, return type, and Media Pool contents. Do not install codecs, transcode, move source files, or import the rest of the batch.

## Display artifacts

- RCM Only already abnormal: inspect source LED/moire/chroma noise revealed by normal Rec.709 contrast.
- RCM Only normal, Neutral Safe abnormal: reduce grading strength, starting with Color Boost.
- Resolve and master normal, delivery abnormal: investigate codec, encoder, profile, chroma, bitrate, GOP, hardware encoding, and secondary compression. Do not change color to compensate.
